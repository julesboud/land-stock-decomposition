# land_stock_decomposition

Uses index theory to decompose national land stocks into price and volume series.
Aims to reduce the bias in productivity measurement from excluding land stocks from input volumes and user costs (see [Diewert, 2008](google.ca)).

We obtain time series decompositions for 7 countries.
See the [paper](Measuring land volume and price for estimation of productivity growth in OECD countries.docx) for details.
